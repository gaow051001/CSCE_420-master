Run Script using 

\> python3 genKB_Sammy.py

\> python3 gen_clauses_Sammy.py

The PROOF are done using the both no-script and script files for KB and CNF, BOTH ARE THE SAME JUST IN DIFFERENT ORDER FOR SOME RULES.
The script KB and CNF are just for the providing a script but have the same rules generated between no-script and script file.

The No-script are just translated manually.
